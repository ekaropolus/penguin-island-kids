st.write('One of the earliest observations of melting icebergs was made by the British explorer James Cook, who noted the presence of large icebergs in the South Pacific in the late 18th century. Since then, scientists have documented a steady decline in the size and number of icebergs around the world, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.')

st.write('The melting of icebergs has significant implications for sea level rise, which threatens to flood coastal cities and low-lying areas. It also has a profound impact on marine ecosystems and the organisms that depend on them, including fish, birds, and marine mammals.')
